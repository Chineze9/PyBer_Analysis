# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the Analysis
 
Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I created a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.  I also used Matplotlib and Pandas to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
 
Results
 
The final result summarizes how the data differs by city type with the total number of drivers for each city type, the fares for each city type as well as the fare per ride for each city type. 
 
Summary
 
But my strongest recommendation is to maintain the  type which displays the Time of the ride to the nearest seconds and one that does not show any fare for the Rural area.
